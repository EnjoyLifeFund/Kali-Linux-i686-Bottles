==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall berkeley-db@4`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/berkeley-db@4/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/berkeley-db@4/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/berkeley-db@4/include
