==> Applying bug-740971.patch
patching file bash_completion
patching file completions/man
==> ./configure --prefix=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/Cellar/bash-completion/1.3_3
==> make install
==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall bash-completion`
==> Caveats
Add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:
  [ -f /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/bash_completion ] && . /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/bash_completion

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/bash_completion.d
