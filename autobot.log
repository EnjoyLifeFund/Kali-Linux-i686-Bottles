==> Not running post_install as we're building a bottle
You can run it manually using `brew postinstall gnu-getopt`
==> Caveats
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because This formula conflicts with util-linux..

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
