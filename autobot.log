#include <stdio.h>
int main() { printf("Ok\n"); return(0); }

I used the command:

	cc -o try -O2 -D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/include -L/usr/local/lib try.c -lpthread -lnsl -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lc
	 ./try

and I got the following output:

/bin/sh: 1: ./try: Accessing a corrupted shared library
The program compiled OK, but exited with status 2.
You have a problem.  Shall I abort Configure [y]  
Ok.  Stopping Configure.
